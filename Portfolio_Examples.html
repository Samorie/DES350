<h1>Good Portfolio Examples</h1>
<h2>By Sammy Lien | DES 350</h2>
	
<h3>Portfolio 1 - https://www.wokine.com</h3>
<li>This portfolio works because the hierachy is very prominent and the design is very effective yet minimal and simplistic. </li>
<li>The site has nice contrast and good balance of colors.</li>	
<li>The overall composition of the website makes it very easy to navigate.</li>		
	
<h3>Portfolio 2 - http://seanhalpin.io/</h3>
<li>I really like the use of the pastel color schemes.</li>
<li>The use of cartoons and doodles as his imagery is really playful. Overall, the portfolio is very simple and creative which makes it fun to navigate the site.</li>
<li>I really like how in his 'works' tab, the background colors compliment to the color palette of his web designs.</li>
	
<h3>Portfolio 3 - https://bepatrickdavid.com/</h3>
<li>The overall layout of the website is very interesting. It's one page that you simply scroll throughout.</li>
<li>Good balance of colors and contrast with nice composition and type.</li>
<li>All of his works are displayed at the bottom rather than just a link to a different page. </li>
